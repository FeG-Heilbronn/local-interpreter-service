# Handouts
This project is intended to produce manuals for visitors.
## Usage
The beste way to customize this manual to your own needs is to open this file in an editor like 
VS-Code and serve the site by local web-server (like with Live-Server-plugin in VS code).
Using the Web-Server approach has also the advantage that you can use the `Variables.json` file 
to customize most important fields.
## Resources
The form imports following resources which have to be replaced
- `./pictures/Logo.svg`
- `./QR-Codes/QrForApp.png`
- `./QR-Codes/QrForWiFi.png`
## Output
After finished you can print this page as manual or just serve the page on a display with open browser.

## Notes
All QR-Codes are created with https://www.qrcode-generator.de/solutions/wifi-qr-code/
